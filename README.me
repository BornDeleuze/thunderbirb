I spun this up so that me and some friends could schedule and reserve outings for our shared (Thunderbird) sailboat. 

I wanted to create something functional and get some practice with typescript and setting up DBs :)

I used typescript here, full calendar for the basic functionality, vite for the build, and firebase for the database.
